# Globals to make R CMD check not spit out "no visible binding for global
#   variable" notes.
# Basically, R CMD check doesn't like it when you don't quote the "V1" in
#   a call like DT[, V1].
# See: http://stackoverflow.com/a/12429344
# Also: see hadley's comments on his own post there. They're great.

# NULL object for common parameter documentation
#' @param es_host A string identifying an Elasticsearch host. This should be of the form
#'        \code{[transfer_protocol][hostname]:[port]}. For example, \code{'http://myindex.thing.com:9200'}.
#' @param es_index The name of an Elasticsearch index to be queried. Note that passing
#'                 \code{NULL} is not supported. Technically, not passing an index
#'                 to Elasticsearch is legal and results in searching over all indexes.
#'                 To be sure that this very expensive query is not executed by accident,
#'                 uptasticsearch forbids this. If you want to execute a query over
#'                 all indexes in the cluster, set this argument to \code{"_all"}.
